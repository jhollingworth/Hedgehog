# Help people to discover .net projects 
# Make downloading and using any projects found as easy as possible

h1. Initial Thoughts

* Web site which allows you find projects
** Information stored: Name, description, tags, versions, dependancies, url's ("Pretty much whatever is on rubygems":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails)
*** Allow people to post links to useful tutorials, news, etc
*** Should we allow voting? e.g. +1 for nhibernate vs subsonic
** People can publish their project's onto the site. Should it be like rubygems where you actually create a file which is then published (could we just use rubygems?)? or should it be a simple html form where you enter info? Edging towards gem's
* Command line app for downloading project
** Very similar to gem's, e.g. hed install nhibernate v=2.001
** @GShutler noted that because we are dealing with compiled languages you can't do all the clever shizzle that ruby does. Possible solutions:
*** Easy solution: is to create a lib directory at the root of the project (pretty much a default anyway) and download files into there 
*** Clever way: See if we can do anything clever with MEF to integrate it?
* Need to make auth as simple as possible, google, facebook connect, etc

Why Hedgehog? Because hedgehogs are badass and so is this project.
